Project Architecture Overview

1. Source Code Management (Git)
    - Developers push code to a remote Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    - Branching strategies (feature, develop, main) are used for code organization.

2. Continuous Integration (Jenkins)
    - Jenkins is configured to monitor the Git repository for code changes.
    - On code push, Jenkins triggers automated build and test pipelines.
    - Jenkins can run unit tests, static code analysis, and build artifacts (e.g., Docker images).

3. Containerization (Docker)
    - Application code is packaged into Docker containers as part of the Jenkins pipeline.
    - Docker images are tagged and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR).

4. Continuous Deployment (Kubernetes)
    - Kubernetes is used to orchestrate and manage containerized applications.
    - Jenkins deploys the latest Docker images to the Kubernetes cluster using deployment manifests (YAML files).
    - Kubernetes handles scaling, load balancing, and self-healing of application pods.

5. Monitoring & Logging
    - Tools like Prometheus (monitoring) and ELK/EFK stack (logging) can be integrated with Kubernetes for observability.

Workflow Summary:
Developer → Git → Jenkins (CI/CD) → Docker Registry → Kubernetes Cluster

Key Components:
- Git: Source code version control
- Jenkins: CI/CD automation
- Docker: Containerization
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration
